# Introduction
Cryptography is a vital field of study and practice in the world of computer science and information security. It deals with securing data and communication by converting it into an unreadable format, which can only be deciphered by individuals who possess the appropriate decryption keys. This writeup provides an overview of key concepts in cryptography and their applications.

# Encryption and Decryption
At its core, cryptography involves two main operations: encryption and decryption.

Encryption: This process involves converting plaintext (the original message) into ciphertext (the encrypted message). This conversion is done using an algorithm and a secret key. The resulting ciphertext should be secure and indecipherable without the key.

Decryption: Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. It takes the ciphertext and the secret key as input and transforms it back into plaintext.

# Types of Cryptography
Cryptography can be categorized into two main types:

Symmetric Cryptography: In symmetric cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Popular algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).

Asymmetric Cryptography: Asymmetric cryptography uses two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This method is commonly used in secure communication and digital signatures. RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) are widely used asymmetric algorithms.

# Common Algorithms
There are several cryptographic algorithms used for various purposes. Some popular ones include:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm known for its security and efficiency.

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): An asymmetric encryption algorithm used for secure data transmission and digital signatures.

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit): A cryptographic hash function commonly used for data integrity verification.

# Applications
Cryptography has numerous real-world applications:

Secure Communication: It ensures that data exchanged between parties is confidential and cannot be intercepted.

Data Integrity: Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the integrity of data.

Digital Signatures: Asymmetric cryptography is used to create and verify digital signatures, which confirm the authenticity of a message or document.
